# RepoSTORY

This is a quick repository that I am making for a class.

This is just an update to the ReadMe file. I have no new information to add.

- I am hoping that the changes I am currently making are occurring on my first branch, entitled b1.

Oneliner code: --- git switch c <name>: create <name> and switch to it in one go
